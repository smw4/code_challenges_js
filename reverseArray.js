//Write a function, reverseArray(), that takes in an array as an argument and returns a new array with the elements in the reverse order.

//create function body
//insert correct array syntax into parameter of function.

//logic of the function:
//- display the array in original order.
//- take the first item in the array,
//    - check if it has a unique ID. Assign one if it does not have one, then place it at the end of a new array.
//    - take the second item in the array and do the same.
//    - take the third item in the array and do the same.

//- Once the function reencounters an item it has already sorted, return the new array.
//    - if the object already has a unique ID, do not move it. Just return the array.

//Calling the function
//    console.log(reverseArray())
